# Waiter

*This project is experimental and is not actively maintained.

Socket based web application to be used as **real-time** order management system for restaurants.
Any new order from any customer is instantly visible on a waiter screen and ready to be processed.
This is just a very simple prototype.

Project is based on Elixir Phoenix framework, and their interesting **Live View** feature.
